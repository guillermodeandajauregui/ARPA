# ARPA
Automatic RT-PCR Analysis; A tool for massive detection of COVID-19

ARPA is designed to help the specialized staff working on the detection of COVId-19 thorugh the technique of RT-PCR. Its main goal is to automatize some laborious steps of the process to speed up the analysis and to decrease the response time.

ARPA has several functionalities:
 - It generates and analyzes the amplification curves from fluoresence measured in a RT-PCR experiment
 - It evaluates the control curves to assess the quality of the experiment
 - It evalutes the sample curves to evaluate the status of each sample
 - It provides a friendly web-interface to look each amplification curve
 - It provides a friendly web-interface to look at a summary table with the results of the experiment
 - It generates pdf reports with the amplification curves and the status per each sample
 - It generates a pdf report with a summary report with the results of the experiment
