# ARPA
Automatic RT-PCR Analysis; A tool for massive detection of COVID-19

## MOTIVATION
ARPA is designed to help the specialized staff working on the detection of COVID-19 thorugh the technique of RT-PCR. ARPA's main goal is to automatize some laborious steps of the process to speed up the analysis and to decrease the response time.

## FUNCTIONALITIES

ARPA has been designed in a modular setting. It allows the automatic analysis of the amplification curves, the visual inspection of the results via a friendly web-interface and the generation of HTML reports with the results from the experiment.

ARPA has several functionalities:

 - It generates and analyzes the amplification curves from fluorescence measured in a RT-PCR experiment
 - It evaluates the control curves to assess the quality of the experiment
 - It evalutes the sample curves to determine the status of each sample
 - It provides a friendly web-interface to look at each amplification curve
 - It provides a friendly web-interface to look at a summary table with the results of the experiment
 - It generates HTML reports with the amplification curves and the status per each sample
 - It generates a HTML report with a QC report of the experiment


### ATUOMATIC ASSESMENT OF THE EXPERIMENT'S QUALITY AND OF THE AMPLIFICATION CURVES 

The values of the fluorescence per cycle are retrieved from the files exportes by the RT-PCR equipment. The curves are evaluated. A correct amplification should behave as a sigmoid curve and cross a fluroescence threshold before a chosen cycle.

All control samples are evaluated to determine the quality of the experiment.

### FRIENDLY WEB-INTERFACE TO LOOK AT THE AMPLIFICATION CURVES AND THE RESULTS OF THE EXPERIMENT

**The web interface allow the user to load the results file generated by the RT-PCR machine**

**It shows the summary table with the status of each sample of the experiment**

**It also allow the visual inspection of the amplification curves per sample**

**Finally, the user can visualize the QC amplification curves**

### AUTOMATIC GENERATION OF PDF REPORTS PER SAMPLE AND A SUMMARY REPORT PER EXPERIMENT

A summary report (in PDF format) with the classification per sample and the metadata of the institute of origin is generated.

An individual report (in PDF format) per sample is generated. It contains the amplificacion curves and classification per sample.

A quality report with the quality assesment and the control amplification curves is generated
